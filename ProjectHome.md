FreeSpeech is free dictation software, an open source alternative to [DragonNaturally Speaking](http://www.nuance.com/)! FreeSpeech provides continuous realtime voice and speech recognition for the desktop (Android soon, hopefully). Offline speaker-independent speech recognition with dynamic language learning. Essentially, FreeSpeech is a front-end for [PocketSphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) with additional learning ability and automation. It automatically manages the difficult process of [creating language models](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM/toolkit_documentation.html).

[PocketSphinx's](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) vocabulary is currently around 133,000 words and growing. Adding new words to the dictionary is done manually, along with their phonetic representation, but we are working on incorporating a word trainer.
