== About ==

FreeSpeech is a realtime speech recognition application for the 
desktop (Android soon, hopefully). Offline speaker-independent voice 
recognition with dynamic language learning capability using the 
[http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ pocketsphinx] back-end. 
Essentially, FreeSpeech is a "front-end" for pocketsphinx with 
additional learning ability and automation. It automatically manages 
the difficult process of creating language models.

== Requirements ==

The following packages should be installed.

  * [http://www.python.org/ Python 2.7]
  * [http://www.pygtk.org/ pygtk2]
  * [http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ gstreamer, including gstreamer-python]
  * [http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ pocketsphinx]
  * [http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM/toolkit_documentation.html CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling Toolkit v2]

== Running FreeSpeech ==

There is no desktop icon yet. Right-click on the desktop to create one.
Launching the program may be done via the Python interpreter.

    python freespeech.py
    
== Troubleshooting ==

Make sure the various requirements work. For example, "pocketsphinx" itself, which may be run from the command line.

== Improving accuracy  ==

The biggest improvements in accuracy have been achieved by adjusting 
the microphone position. The volume level is adjusted automatically 
and tweaking it is not likely to improve much. You may try making a 
recording with [http://audacity.sourceforge.net Audacity] and 
checking the noise levels to make sure it sounds like intelligible 
speech when played back.

The language model that ships with this download, 
"freespeech.ref.txt" is likely to be very limited. Our excuse is 
that being pared-down as it is will save memory while providing room 
to more easily learn your manner of speaking. Don't be surprised if 
it does not work very well for you at first. Use the keyboard to 
manually edit the text in the box until it says what you intended to 
say. Then hit the "Learn" button. It will try to do better at 
understanding you next time!

Don't worry if you inadvertently teach it bad grammar. The file  
"freespeech.ref.txt" may be manually corrected. Changes will appear 
next time you hit the "Learn" button.

The language model may be further 
[http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM/toolkit_documentation.html#evallm 
tweaked and improved].

If there is a word that it stubbornly refuses to recognize, even 
after using it in several sentences, you may need to edit the 
dictionary: "freespeech.dic"

Adapt pocketsphinx to your voice for better accuracy.
